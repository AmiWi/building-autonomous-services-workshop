# Make the *Purchase* context autonomous

The *Purchase* context currently has a runtime dependency on the *Catalog* context. It needs to ask *Catalog* for a list of product IDs and names, in order to display the "Receive goods" form. In this assignment we're going to make sure that *Purchase* doesn't have to *ask Catalog* for product IDs and names anymore.

> Which *event* would *Purchase* need to listen to, in order to be able to keep its own list of products?

1. In *Catalog*, use `Stream::produce($messageType, $data)` to publish an event after creating a new product. It needs a message type (a simple string) and relevant data (anything will do, as long as it's JSON serializable, e.g. an array or an object with public properties).
2. Check out the logs (`make logs`) to confirm that the existing `consumer` service picks up the newly produced event message.
3. Now, create a consumer for the *Purchase* context.
    - Copy `src/Common/consumer.php` to `src/Purchase`.
    - Copy the `consumer` service definition in `docker-compose.yml`. Pick a different service name, and make sure it points to [`src/Purchase/consumer.php`](../src/Purchase/consumer.php) (instead of the one in `Common`).
    - Run `make up` again to start your new consumer.
4. When the *Purchase* consumer receives an event about a new product being created, it should keep track of this product in its own local database. Define a class for such a "local" product in `src/Purchase`. When the event comes in, create a new instance of this `Product` and copy the product data (ID and name) into it. Use `Database::persist($object)` to persist the new `Product` object. The underlying data storage for `Database` is a file in `./var`. The requirements for persisting an object with `Database::persist()` are:
    - Every attribute **must** have a PHP annotation indicating its type, e.g.
        ```php
        /**
         * @var int
         */
        private $productId
        ```
    - The class **must** have a public `id()` method which returns a *unique identifier* for the object. 
5. In `PurchaseApplication::receiveGoodsController()`, replace the call to `HttpApi::fetchDecodedJsonResponse('http://catalog_web/listProducts');` with a call to `Database::retrieveAll($className)`.

## Questions:

- Since you may have created a product before you started publishing events about it, your database may contain products, which are not in the stream. Hence, they are not stored as local products in the *Purchase* context. What would be needed to fix these inconsistencies? Think of/discuss several strategies.
- What happens if you have a bug in your consumer and it doesn't process an incoming event correctly? Take a look at the code and comments of `Stream::consume()` and find out what its built-in mechanism is to counter this situation. What does this mean for the implementation of the consumer?

## Further improvements

- You could take essentially the same steps for the *Sales* context, since that context also has a runtime dependency on *Catalog*. If you're waiting for the next assignment, you might as well use your time to make *Sales* autonomous too.
