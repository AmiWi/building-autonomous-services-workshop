# Gain some insight into the long-running sales order process

It would be very helpful to see the current status of every sales order process. We already have the data (the `OrderStatus` objects and the status information it keeps), so all we have to do is render a nice page in the *Sales* service, listing all the statuses. You could show only the orders that are still "open".

To add some more detail to the process status you could add the current time to every state transition and show it in the list too.
