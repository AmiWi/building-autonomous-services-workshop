# Turn `OrderStatus` into an actual state-tracker 

The `OrderStatus` object has a field for remembering which purchase order has been created for the sales order. But it doesn't remember the current state of the sales order process.

You could distinguish the following states:

- Sales order created
- Awaiting stock reservation
- Awaiting goods received (only if the reservation fails)
- Sales order delivered

Whenever there is a transition in the sales order process, like when the process manager automatically creates the purchase order, we should update and persist the `OrderStatus` object to remember its current state. This way, we can later gain some insight into the process. We could find out how many sales orders are waiting for their goods to be received.

Enhance `OrderStatus` to make it possible, and make the right calls in the process manager.

## State machine

You should design `OrderStatus` to be more like a state machine in the sense that you don't allow it to make certain state transitions. E.g. once the sales order has been delivered, it shouldn't be possible to associate a purchase order with it. In that case, explicit failure would be helpful in debugging the system.
