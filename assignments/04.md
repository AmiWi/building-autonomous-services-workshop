# Auto-create a purchase order

Usually, after a sales order has been created, we need to verify that we have enough of the ordered products in stock. If this is the case, we collect those products, and "deliver the order" (See `Sales` - `Deliver a Sales Order`). If we don't have sufficient stock levels to deliver the sales order, someone needs to manually set up a purchase order, so we can meet the customer's requirements.

We want to save some time and let the system do this automatically for us.

1. We accept a sales order.
2. We verify that we have enough of all the ordered products in stock.
3. If we don't, we need to place a purchase order for the products that we don't have enough of.

Let's first set this up the simple way. That is, once a sales order has been created, immediately create a purchase order for it. This is overshooting our target by a lot, but it's a good start. Copy this code into the `SalesApplication::createSalesOrderController()` right after `Database::persist($salesOrder)` - after all, that's when we want to auto-create the purchase order:

```php
$purchaseOrderId = (string)PurchaseOrderId::create();

$formData = [
    'purchaseOrderId' => $purchaseOrderId,
    'productId' => $salesOrder->productId(),
    'quantity' => $salesOrder->quantity()
];

HttpApiExtra::postFormData(
    'http://purchase_web/createPurchaseOrder',
    $formData
);
```

Improve on this code by retrieving current stock levels from *Stock* and decide whether or not a product needs to be added to the purchase order.

## Questions

- What have we done? We have created a direct, runtime dependency between *Sales* and *Purchase*! Not very smart, since the request for making a sales order might fail, even though the reason for this failure is a problem in *Purchase*. Can you think of a solution for the lack in autonomy?
- Consider the following situation: when we check for the current stock level of a product, right after that the product is delivered to someone else, so that when we try to deliver our sales order, it won't be possible anymore (and we should have added it to the purchase order after all!).
