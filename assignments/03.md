# 3. A new feature: auto-generate a purchase proposal

A product has a "minimum stock level". When you'd place an order, which brings the stock level of a product below this minimum level, we should create a purchase order for these products. Your job is to build such a proposal in the background. A proposal itself consists of a single `OrderProposal`, with multiple lines, describing how much should be ordered for each product to bring it back to its minimum levels.

You could start out writing the solution in a synchronous way first, i.e. making web requests and building up the proposal. Or you could try building it using events.

To add a new controller to the *Purchase* service, create a public method (e.g. `orderProposalAction`) on the `PurchasApplication` class. You can then reach that controller by visiting `http://purchase.localhost/orderProposal`.
