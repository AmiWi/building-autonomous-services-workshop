# The reservation pattern

To safely make stock-related transactions in a highly concurrent environment, we should leave the decision about "do we have enough of this product in stock" to the *Stock* context itself. This requires a bit of a different setup, but we can rely on two well-known and important things:

1. The Reservation pattern
2. The idea of a Process Manager

First, a *reservation* is like a two-step transaction. Given we have a sales order for 2 items of product A.

1. Make a reservation by calling the *Stock* context and asking it to reserve 2 items of product A.
2. Wait for a confirmation that these items have been reserved, before taking further steps in the process.

At this point the process manager comes into play: we need to somehow remember that we've made a reservation and are waiting for a confirmation. We also need to take further steps, based on the outcome of the reservation ("accepted" or "stock level too low").
